# What does the Script do? 

The script feeds a JSON containing any amount of tweets into Spark a Spark Dataframe, does some cleaning then performs a polarity analysis. The Tweets were scraped with snscrape (https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape). 

A data sample containing just a couple of tweets to Elon Musk will be provided in this repository.
